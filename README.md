# IMDB Sentiment Classification with GloVe and Keras NN

The project uses the popular deep learning library Keras to build a neural network and the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to represent the words in the reviews. The model is trained on the IMDB dataset and can be used to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews. It can be a good starting point for anyone interested in using deep learning for natural language processing tasks
<br>Dataset contains 2 columns,
